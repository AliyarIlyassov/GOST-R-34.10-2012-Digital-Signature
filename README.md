# GOST-R-34.10-2012-Digital-Signature
GOST R 34.10-2012 is based on elliptic curves. The robustness of this algorithm is based on the complexity of computing the discrete logarithm in a group of points on an elliptic curve, as well as on the persistence of the hash function. For GOST R 34.10-2012, a hash function is used according to GOST R 34.11-2012.
